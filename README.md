1. [input year] -> actual year, current or previous.
2. put input .txt file with data (i get mine from the TGMC discord's #game-updates channel)
3. check if the data's spelling of the map names fit with the program (if they do not just change the `"name:"` definitions inside the dicts for the appropriate maps)
4. run program via `RunData.bat`
5. you will have the option to pick between manually putting in the month/year desired or having it done automatically for the current month/year you run the program at.
6. the program will run and given that everything you have done is the exact same way i have done it, it *should* work.
# MAINTENANCE
shouldn't be anything major, maybe check anything with `# NEW MONTH:` attached to it but otherwise eh.
