# TGMC-data-collectors-and-compiler
terrible python code that i really don't care that much about and just use privately

# HOW-TO-USE
1. setup so everything works as outlined in this video: https://youtu.be/cnPlKLEGR7E
2. setup a .txt file that it reads from and put in the TGMC data there, personally i just get the data from the discord's #game-updates but you do you just make sure to fit it in with the code or adjust the code to make it work.
3. this is how the files & directories should (roughly) look like to make the code work:

4. run in vsc or whatever
5. cry

# MAINTENANCE
Just ctrl+f any stuff titled "NEW MONTH:" after the end of the month and make sure that the dates are accurate

also with how this code works you'll have to make a new spreadsheet for every month, sorry not sorry.
