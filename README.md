1. make things generally look like above
2. input TGMC_[month].txt file with data (i get mine from the TGMC discord's #game-updates channel)
3. create config.txt file that looks somewhat like this

4. run program via `RunData.bat` or in your debugger or whatever other method you prefer
5. you can choose what data to calculate by year/month manually, for current year/month, and for previous year/month
6. the program will run and given that everything you have done is the exact same way i have done it, it *should* work.
# MAINTENANCE
shouldn't be anything major, maybe check anything with `# NEW MONTH:` or `# TODO:` attached to it but otherwise eh.
