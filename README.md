# TGMC-data-collectors-and-compiler
terrible python code that i really don't care that much about and just use privately

# HOW-TO-USE

1. [input year] -> actual year, current or previous.
2. put input .txt file with data (i get mine from the TGMC discord's #game-updates channel)
3. check if the data's spelling of the map names fit with the program (if they do not just change the `"name:"` definitions inside the dicts for the appropriate maps)
4. run program through `py compile_and_parse.py` in command-line or through VSC, you pick however you want to do it.
5. you'll be quickly asked for some input on wheter the data is from previous or current month/year (todo: let you pick which month/year through numbers instead of Y/N)
6. the program will run and given that everything you have done is the exact same way i have done it, it *should* work.
# MAINTENANCE
shouldn't be anything major, maybe check anything with `# NEW MONTH:` attached to it but otherwise eh.
