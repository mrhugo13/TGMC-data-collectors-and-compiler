# TGMC-data-collectors-and-compiler
terrible python code that i really don't care that much about and just use privately

# HOW-TO-USE
1. setup so everything works as outlined in this video: https://youtu.be/cnPlKLEGR7E
2. setup a .txt file that it reads from and put in the TGMC data there, personally i just get the data from the discord's #game-updates but you do you just make sure to fit it in to make it work.
3. run in vsc or whatever
4. cry

# MAINTENANCE
Just ctrl+f any stuff titled "NEW MONTH:" and make sure that the datas are accurate as they should be
